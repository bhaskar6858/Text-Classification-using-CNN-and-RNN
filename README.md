# Text-Classification-using-CNN-and-RNN
This project focuses on classifying news articles into four categories using deep learning techniques. It explores two powerful architectures:  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for capturing local patterns in text. A hybrid CNN + Bidirectional LSTM (RNN) model for understanding both local and sequential dependencies in news articles.
